# R6S-MapViewer

While playing Rainbow Six: Siege you can open the MapViewer on a different screen and scroll through the map layouts with room names and camera positions.

It sisplays pictures in the res folder, so you can add your own pictures of maps. Has a global hook for the left and right buttons of the keyboard, so you can switch layout while you are in RainbowSix:Siege.

You can find the latest version here: https://github.com/Thypari/R6S-MapViewer/releases
