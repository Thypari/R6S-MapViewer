# R6S-MapViewer

## Description
While playing Rainbow Six: Siege you can open the MapViewer on a different screen and scroll through the map layouts with room names and camera positions without minimizing the game.

## How does it work?
It uses all pictures in the res folder, so you can add your own pictures of maps. It has a global hook for the left and right buttons of the keyboard, so you can switch layout while you are in Rainbow Six:Siege.

You can find the latest version here: https://github.com/Thypari/R6S-MapViewer/releases

#### TO-DO:
2. Settings to change the buttons
1. Automatically change to the current map while loading in-game
